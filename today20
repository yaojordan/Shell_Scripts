洨叮噹 has a pocket from which he produces gadgets, medicines, and tools from the future. The pocket is called yōjigen-pocket (literally "fourth-dimensional pocket"). Some of the gadgets (dōgu) are based on real Japanese household devices with fanciful twists, but most are completely science fiction (although some may be based on folklore or religious stories). Thousands of dōgu have been featured in 洨叮噹." The number of gadgets has been approximated at 4,500. It is this constant variety which makes 洨叮噹 popular both among children and among adults. In the series, the availability of dōgu sometimes depends on the money 洨叮噹 has available, and he often says some dōgu are expensive in the future. The more famous ones include the "bamboo-copter" (which is very similar to the one that appears on the older series of Beany and Cecil), a small head accessory that allows flight; the "Anywhere Door," a door that opens up to any place the user wishes; and the "Time Machine." Some of the recurring dōgu also appear in Fujiko F. Fujio's other works, including 21-emon, Kaibutsu-kun, Kiteretsu Daihyakka, Mikio to Mikio, and Pāman.
